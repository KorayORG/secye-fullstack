# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Supplier'ların kendi general sayfalarında bulunan Son 30 Gün, Ürün Çeşidi, Toplam Sipariş verilerini gerçek veri olarak görebilsinler. Son 30 Gün verisi mağazam sayfasındaki istatistiklerde bulunan 30 günlük veri nasıl çekliyorsa öyle çekilsin. Ürün Çeşidi verisi mağazamızda ekli kaç çeşit ürün varsa o sayı olacak. Toplam sipariş verisi şuana kadar aldığımız toplam sipariş sayısını gösterecek."

        comment: "Updated supplier dashboard API (/api/supplier/{company_id}/dashboard) to use real data sources: 1) Toplam Sipariş - counts all orders from 'orders' collection filtered by supplier_id, 2) Ürün Çeşidi - counts active products from 'products' collection, 3) Son 30 Gün - uses same logic as stats API with 30-day period filter. Changed from using 'supplier_orders' and 'supplier_products' collections to 'orders' and 'products' collections to match the stats API implementation."

        comment: "Frontend already displays dashboard data correctly. SupplierPanel.js calls /api/supplier/{company_id}/dashboard API and shows the three requested metrics: 1) Toplam Sipariş - displayed in dashboard card as total_orders, 2) Ürün Çeşidi - displayed as product_variety, 3) Son 30 Gün - displayed as recent_orders. No frontend changes needed as the dashboard already renders these values from the API response."

Changes: 1) Toplam Sipariş - now counts from 'orders' collection (was 'supplier_orders'), 2) Ürün Çeşidi - now counts active products from 'products' collection (was 'supplier_products'), 3) Son 30 Gün - uses same logic as stats API with 30-day date filter. Frontend already displays these values correctly in dashboard cards. Ready for user testing."

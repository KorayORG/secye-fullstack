<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully progressed the Seç Ye application, a multi-tenant food selection platform, through significant development phases. Starting from an existing MVP with core authentication and an admin panel, the engineer tackled user-requested expansions. The primary focus was on implementing the detailed sub-modules for the Corporate panel (Phases 1 and 2) and laying foundational elements for Catering and Supplier panels (Phase 3). Key achievements include developing backend APIs for Employee Management (including bulk upload), Shift Management, Catering Management, System Settings, and Mail/Internal Messaging. The engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills by identifying and resolving critical issues like missing  dependency and a pandas DataFrame error in the bulk import functionality. Frontend components were created, and routing logic was updated to support the new panel types. The current state is that all backend APIs for the implemented modules are functional and tested, and frontend component files are in place, awaiting detailed UI implementation and integration, with a request for user confirmation before proceeding with frontend testing.

<product_requirements>
The Seç Ye application is designed as a multi-tenant platform for corporate, catering, and supplier users to manage menu selection, scoring, suggestions, offers, and company operations. It emphasizes a mobile-first, intuitive UI with an orange + white theme and dark green accents, aiming for cool but calm micro-animations and simplicity. Performance targets include LCP <= 2.5s and p95 API <= 300ms, achieved through techniques like skeleton loaders and caching. Security features include RBAC, HMAC-signed path segments, Argon2id for passwords, and CSRF protection. The system supports various roles across corporate, catering, and supplier tenants, in addition to owners. Core data models involve Company, User, RoleAssignment, Shift, MenuFrame, Choice, Rating, and AuditLog, using UUIDs for identifiers. The previous AI engineer established the core authentication, master admin panel, and migrated to real database integration, setting the foundation for the current feature expansion.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed the implementation of Phase 1 (Corporate Panel Core Modules) and Phase 2 (System & Communication) at the backend API level, and laid the foundations for Phase 3 (Catering & Supplier panels) on the frontend.

Specifically:
- **Backend APIs**: All necessary APIs for Employee Management (including bulk Excel upload), Shift Management, Catering Management, System Settings, and Mail/Messaging are implemented and tested, with all identified bugs resolved. A critical fix involved adding  to  and correcting a pandas DataFrame column issue in the bulk import function within .
- **Frontend Components**: Placeholder  files for , , , , and  have been created under . The  has been updated to import and structure these new module components.
- **Routing**:  and  have been created as foundational components, and a new  component, along with updates to , has been implemented to handle intelligent routing between Corporate, Catering, and Supplier panels.

The system now has a robust backend for the main corporate features and a frontend structure ready for detailed UI implementation. The AI engineer is currently at a point where all backend work for the initially requested modules is complete and confirmed, and the frontend scaffolding is in place. The next immediate step is to seek user approval for proceeding with frontend testing.

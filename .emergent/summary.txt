<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully implemented a multi-phase feature addition to an existing full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB application. Initially, it developed an offer submission system, allowing companies to send catering firms price and message proposals, with firms viewing all caterers and a dedicated Offers section for catering panels. After successful testing of this core functionality, the user requested significant enhancements: real-time data integration for catering firm listings, the introduction of time-bound agreements, and a two-sided agreement termination process with mandatory reasons/messages. The AI engineer systematically addressed these by first updating frontend components for real data, then designing and implementing new backend models (, ) and APIs, and finally integrating these features into the frontend, including offer duration selection, termination buttons, and a notification system for termination requests. Throughout, the engineer demonstrated proficiency in both backend (FastAPI, MongoDB model updates, API creation) and frontend (React, Tailwind, component creation, state management) development, handling minor syntax errors efficiently. The work culminated in a complete, tested, and robust contract management system.

<product_requirements>
The user required a comprehensive catering management system with two main phases of development:

**Phase 1: Offer Submission System**
The initial request was to allow Firmalar (Companies) to view all Catering Firmaları (Catering Firms). Instead of an Add button, there should be a Teklif Gönder (Send Offer) button. Clicking this button should open a form where companies can specify a birim öğün başına ne kadar ödeyebileceklerini (unit meal price) and a message. This offer message should be conveyed to the catering firm. Catering firms, in turn, need a Teklifler (Offers) section in their panel to control gelen ve gönderilen teklifleri (received and sent offers). If an offer is accepted, both parties should see each other as Partner Catering Firmaları (Partner Catering Firms) on the company side, and Anlaşmalı Firmalar (Agreed-upon Companies) on the catering side.

**Phase 2: Timed Agreements and Two-Sided Termination System**
Following the successful implementation of Phase 1, the user requested enhancements:
1.  **Real Database Connection**: The Firmalar and Tedarikçiler (Suppliers) panels for catering firms should display data directly from the database, not sample data. Accepted offers should lead to firms being listed under Anlaşmalı Firmalar.
2.  **Timed Agreements**: Offers and subsequent agreements should be for specific durations (e.g., 6 months, 1 year), with start and end dates.
3.  **Agreement Termination (Fesih) System**: An İşi Sonlandır (End Agreement) option is needed, requiring approval from both parties.
4.  **Termination Process**: Fesih requests should appear as notifications on the Teklifler page. A fesih form should open, making a message and reason for termination mandatory. The counter-party must be able to approve or reject the termination.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed the implementation of all requested features, encompassing both the offer submission system and the more advanced timed agreement and two-sided termination functionalities.

**Current State of the Product:**
1.  **Offer Submission**: Companies can now view all catering firms and send them offers via a Teklif Gönder button. The offer form includes fields for unit meal price, a message, and a new Anlaşma Süresi (Agreement Duration) dropdown (3, 6, 12, 24, 36 months).
2.  **Offer Management**: Catering firms have an Offers section where they can view received offers and their details, including the new duration. They can accept or reject these offers.
3.  **Real Data Integration**: The Firmalar (Corporates) and Tedarikçiler (Suppliers) sections in the Catering panel now display real data fetched from the database, rather than mock data. Upon offer acceptance, a  is created in the backend, linking the parties.
4.  **Agreement Display**: Accepted offers result in the display of Anlaşmalı Firmalar (Agreed-upon Companies) in the respective panels.
5.  **Termination System**:
    *   **Initiation**: Both corporate and catering users can initiate a Fesih (Terminate) request for an active agreement from their respective panels.
    *   **Form**: A termination dialog pops up, requiring a mandatory reason and message for the request.
    *   **Two-sided Approval**: The termination request is sent to the other party.
    *   **Notification**: Termination requests appear as notifications within the Teklifler (Offers) section of the  component.
    *   **Action**: The recipient can Onayla (Approve) or Reddet (Reject) the termination request, completing the two-sided approval process.
    *   **Contract Lifecycle**: If approved, the contract is terminated in the backend.

The AI engineer has provided detailed instructions for the user to test the newly implemented features, covering the entire workflow from sending an offer to testing the termination process.

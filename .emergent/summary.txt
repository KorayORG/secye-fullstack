The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Seç Ye application from an MVP to a more feature-rich state. This initial phase focused on building out the Corporate panel's backend APIs for employee, shift, catering, system settings, and mail management, while also scaffolding the frontend components and routing for Corporate, Catering, and Supplier panels. Critical issues like missing  and a pandas DataFrame error in bulk import were resolved.

The current trajectory details a comprehensive bug-fixing phase initiated by the user. The primary issues identified were: a severe data isolation flaw where users could see employees from other companies, Element type is invalid errors in MailSystem,  value errors in SystemSettings, non-functional save in SystemSettings, a non-responsive detail button in CateringManagement, network errors during bulk uploads, and empty content pages in Catering/Supplier panels.

The AI engineer systematically addressed these bugs by modifying backend APIs () to enforce data isolation, add missing endpoints for various panel types (settings, audit logs, mail, bulk upload, excel templates), and correcting frontend components (, , , , , ) to dynamically handle company types, fix  issues, and add placeholder UI content. All fixes were confirmed via backend testing, resolving the critical security and functionality gaps.

<product_requirements>
The Seç Ye application is a multi-tenant platform for corporate, catering, and supplier users to manage menu selection, scoring, suggestions, offers, and company operations. It targets a mobile-first, intuitive UI with an orange/white theme and dark green accents, aiming for cool but calm micro-animations and simplicity. Performance goals are LCP <= 2.5s and p95 API <= 300ms, using skeleton loaders and caching. Security involves RBAC, HMAC-signed paths, Argon2id for passwords, and CSRF protection. Core data models include Company, User, RoleAssignment, Shift, MenuFrame, Choice, Rating, and AuditLog, using UUIDs. The previous phase established core authentication, a master admin panel, and real database integration, building a foundation for corporate panel features (employee, shift, catering, system settings, mail) and initial scaffolding for catering and supplier panels. The current work focuses on fixing critical bugs identified during the initial rollout of these features.

    *   Implemented missing  API endpoints for updating company settings across Corporate, Catering, and Supplier panels.
    *   Added  and  endpoints for Catering and Supplier company settings and audit logs in the backend.
    *   Modified the  frontend component to dynamically use API endpoints based on the  prop passed to it.
3.  **Mail System**:
    *   Resolved an Element type is invalid error and  component empty value issues by assigning a default value in .
    *   Added comprehensive , , ,  API endpoints for mail operations for Catering and Supplier companies.
    *   Modified the  frontend component to dynamically use API endpoints based on the  prop.
4.  **Bulk Upload Network Error**:
    *   Resolved Network Error during bulk uploads by implementing missing  endpoints for employee bulk import and  endpoints for Excel templates for Catering and Supplier companies.
    *   Modified the  frontend component to dynamically use API endpoints based on the  prop.
5.  **Empty Content Pages**:
    *   Added placeholder UI content to  for Firmalar and Tedarikçiler.
    *   Added placeholder UI content to  for Catering Firmaları and Mağazam.

All backend fixes have undergone comprehensive testing using , with 28/28 API tests passing and data isolation confirmed. The system is now functionally correct regarding these previously reported bugs and securely handles data access.
